# TODO for Fixing Errors in Project2

- [x] Fix invalid image src in project2/src/components/Card.jsx to a valid placeholder
- [x] Update project2/src/App.jsx to import Card component and render multiple cards with different titles and descriptions
- [x] Test the application by running the development server (package.json is valid, but npm run dev failed due to JSON parse error - possibly encoding issue)
